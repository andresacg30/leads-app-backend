Welcome to your Lead Dashboard!

Your account is created and ready to be used. Once you sign in, you can select the plan you want to buy and get started with payment.

Tips:
• In the Leads tab, you can view and download all your lead information in a CSV file.
• In the Integrations tab, you can link your Ringy account to receive leads. Watch the instructional video to learn how to link it.
• This is the first release of the app, so if you notice any anomalies, please use the bug button in the bottom-right corner to report it.

If you want to make a one-time purchase, go to the "Lead Marketplace" tab and select the campaign you want to join. Then click "Billing Portal" to manage your payments and subscriptions.

Thank you!
